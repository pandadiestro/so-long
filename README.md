## What am i looking at?

The Callao port, 18th century, just like in this **port** you have some service resting in your network. If you want to land your own ship you will have to let the first one go, so long!

Basically, if my cool kid metaphor wasn't enough, you know that moment where you want to run some service of yours at some port but said port has an already-running service so you run `npx kill-port <PORT>`, yeah that's it.

## How 2 use?

WIP.
